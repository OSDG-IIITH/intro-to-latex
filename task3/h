abstract = {Abstract For decades, the revolution in design and fabrication
            methodology of flexible capacitive pressure sensors using various
            inorganic/organic materials has significantly enhanced the field of
            flexible and wearable electronics with a wide range of applications
            in aerospace, automobiles, marine environment, robotics, healthcare,
            and consumer/portable electronics. Mathematical modelling, finite
            element simulations, and unique fabrication strategies are utilized
            to fabricate diverse shapes of diaphragms, shells, and cantilevers
            which function in normal, touch, or double touch modes, operation
            principles inspired from microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based
            capacitive pressure sensing techniques. The capacitive pressure
            sensing technique detects changes in capacitance due to the
            deformation/deflection of a pressure sensitive mechanical element
            that alters the separation gap of the capacitor. Due to advancement
            in state-of-the-art fabrication technologies, the performance and
            properties of capacitive pressure sensors are enhanced. In this
            review paper, recent progress in flexible capacitive pressure
            sensing techniques in terms of design, materials, and fabrication
            strategies is reported. The mechanics and fabrication steps of
            paper-based low-cost MEMS/flexible devices are also broadly
            reported. Lastly, the applications of flexible capacitive pressure
            sensors, challenges, and future perspectives are discussed.},

abstract = {Flexible and stretchable electronics can dramatically enhance the application of electronics for the emerging Internet of Everything applications where people, processes, data and devices will be integrated and connected, to augment quality of life. Using naturally flexible and stretchable polymeric substrates in combination with emerging organic and molecular materials, nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, and 2D atomic crystal structured materials, significant progress has been made in the general area of such electronics. However, high volume manufacturing, reliability and performance per cost remain elusive goals for wide commercialization of these electronics. On the other hand, highly sophisticated but extremely reliable, batch-fabrication-capable and mature complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-based technology has facilitated tremendous growth of today's digital world using thin-film-based electronics; in particular, bulk monocrystalline silicon (100) which is used in most of the electronics existing today. However, one fundamental challenge is that state-of-the-art CMOS electronics are physically rigid and brittle. Therefore, in this work, how CMOS-technology-enabled flexible and stretchable electronics can be developed is discussed, with particular focus on bulk monocrystalline silicon (100). A comprehensive information base to realistically devise an integration strategy by rational design of materials, devices and processes for Internet of Everything electronics is offered.},
